Overall: Cool landing page. Great UI and UX. Most of the functionalities are done well. The code is a bit messy but nothing terrible. Overall, there're no
singular big problems in this project. Many minor things though. I would like to see a three man project to be more polished. The bonus related to the map is a
little confusing but I'll give it to you.

Communication:
- Interface is easy and well organized.
- The types are not consistently used. 
- All expected interfaces are created. 
- The documentation is good. A little excessive. A small few functions probably deserves a small explaination at the top. 
- Code mostly follows the style guide.
- References are stated.
- 96/100

Thinking:
- Search/sort table results displays, on average, 0.5 ms
- No singular operation above 1000 ms.
- Good use of algorithms and data structures. 
- The most appropriate algorithm for each sub problem was mostly used.
- Selected algorithms were modified and applied decently.
- The project is decently optimal for both time complexity and space complexity
- Unit tests are missing.
- 88/100

Application:
- Great use of variables. Some variable names are questionable.
- Great use of functions. Few redundant code. Some function names were a bit questionable.
- Asymptotic bound stated.
- No JS array methods.
- No Maps/Sets
- Code is mostly consistently formatted.
- 93/100
